                    <div class="abt-what-kora">
                        <p>The word “Kora” brings together many cultures, right from West Africa to the Indian subcontinent. In the far away land of West Africa, Kora refers to a musical instrument, but travelling a little up north, the word Kora takes on a whole new meaning in Greek mythology, to mean maiden. From Greece, where it is believed to have its origins, as the word makes its way more eastward Kora can be found, tucked away in the shadow of the Himalayas in Tibet and Bhutan where it means ‘revolution’ or ‘circumambulation’ in pilgrimages and 
                                meditative practices.
                                Our Kora is derived from Sanskrit, one of the world’s oldest languages, which is close to the Bhutanese language of Dzongkha and its meaning, implies a ‘circular journey’.</p>
                        <p>The journey of the word itself from the African continent to the meeting point of Eurasia and deeper into the Asian continent, creates an endless, boundless, infinite adventure, signifying exotic travel through this vast world.Kora carries with it a musical, mythical and spiritual essence that denotes aspects of a journey with meaning and purpose.
                                Staying true to its meaning, Kora Journeys has been founded out of an undying passion, hard work and dedication of a single travel professional who has close to over two decades of working in the evergreen, glamorous travel industry. The idea was conceived as a dream to hand craft pure, authentic and experiential luxury travel, transcending into a journey, intended to change and leave a
                                lasting impact on the way you view this beautiful world.

                            <p>The founder’s unconditional striving to spread love, respect and happiness by way of travel defines an unshakeable foundation that Kora Journeys stand on.

                            <p>When you embark on a journey, closing the door to your home and every familiar thing you’ve known so far, you’re taking a step into an exotic world of beauty, glamour, history, art, culture, architecture, timeless monuments, scenic beauty and all the good that a foreign country has to offer. But as you tread further onto that adventure, it also presents the not-so-glamorous, darker side to
                                    every country and city - the pain of a large section of society, all locals, who struggle to meet the basics of life.</p>

                            <p>World at heart & people at soul, Sunitta’s exploration began at the age of 10 with her first overseas journey into Japan, land of the Rising Sun; and for her, that metaphorical sun has never set, only growing brighter with every expedition.
                            </p>
                            <p>An undying passion for history, art, culture, architecture, nature, wildlife & food led to a strategic career plan to be part of the Travel Industry. After her Bachelor’s Degree, she received her Masters in Tourism & Travel Industry Management at the University of Mumbai, and bagged the first rank , and
                                    embarked on an exciting career starting with Singapore Airlines. Soon, she realized that her passion lies in designing memorable journeys to exotic locals across the world.</p>
                                    <p>Giving up a prestigious airline job, she joined Thomas Cook. Now spanning an incredible travel career of 19 years across India, UK & US, she has traveled to over 84 countries, worked with the finest luxury tour operators, built strong
                                            connections with the suppliers and other travel industry peers along the way, and created a vast global network of not just the creme de la creme hotels, spas, guides, but also with deep down locals in some of the most unimaginable destinations.</p>

                        <div class="abt-what-kora">
                            <p>Travel doesn’t necessarily have to be a self gratifying experience. Infact it is most enhanced when shared with others,  especially through interactions with local communities at your destinations. Not only does that help you understand the culture better but also helps you respect the country and its people, and become an impactful traveller.</p>
                            <p>Besides giving you a lifetime experience, Kora Journeys is all about using travel to make a difference in the world, no matter how small. We are dedicated to encouraging travellers to contribute to sustainable and responsible tourism, in whatever ways they can. Choosing to share your experience with Kora Journeys itself is one step in the responsible direction in a way, because we support the local communities in all our destinations, providing them with support and growth for their families and children. We believe that if done correctly, tourism can not only maximize the socio-economic benefits of the local communities but also minimize negative impacts of poor education and health on the lives of the less fortunate, those that have no access to the basics of everyday life. Through ‘Impactful Travel’ we also advocate for better preservation of cultural heritage and history and the environment.</p>

                            <p>Being a Western traveller, exposure to the exotic locations, would also give you insights into the struggles of the locals and the underprivileged. Besides giving you a good time, we also aim to create awareness for the needs of this world and as global citizens, we hope that this would lead you to extend your support towards various causes, and to value your current lifestyle at the least. </p>
                            <p>Tourism has the ability to penetrate a country’s policy and generate employment, so why not take the opportunity to create an impact? Why not use travel as a means to touch those many beautiful hearts once, memories of that positive & loving feel to last for ever in the minds.</p>
